     <br>
     <img src="images\wider.png" alt="images">
     <p class="lines">Wilder World enables multi-leveled, photorealistic, and mixed reality worlds where Wilders
        roam freely, acquire virtual land and express themselves through unique avatars, decorative assets,
        and fashionable accessories. Wilder World is fully owned and governed by its community — creators, players,
         and fans alike are enabled to participate via the Wilder DAO on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

The key difference with Sandbox is that players have true ownership of the virtual world assets in the form of NFTs. By doing so, players and creators will be able to participate in the economy by asset trading and earning through tokens, making Sandbox also considered a play-to-earn game.</p>
